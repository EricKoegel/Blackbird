Name: Blackbird
Summary: Desktop Suite for Xfce.

Copyright 2012 Simon Steinbeiß
Blackbird is dual-licensed as GPLv2 or later and CC-BY-SA 3.0 or later.

Note/Caveat: This is a rather dark theme and unfortunately bears some of the issues that most dark themes have. A few of the known issues affect LibreOffice and QT applications. I expect to be able to fix some of them in the future, but maybe not all.

The Blackbird desktop suite includes:
– GTK2 theme
– GTK3 theme (WIP
– Xfwm4 theme

Dependencies (GTK3>=3.3):
– gtk2-engines-murrine (v0.90)
– gtk3-engines-unico (v1.0.2)
